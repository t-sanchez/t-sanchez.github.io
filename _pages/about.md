I am working as a postdoctoral research at the [Medical Image Analysis Laboratory](https://wp.unil.ch/mial/) with Mertixell Bach Cuadra, in the SP CHUV-UNIL unit of the [Center for Biomedial Imaging (CIBM)](https://cibm.ch/). My current project revolves around developing a deep learning-based quality control pipeline for fetal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 

I previously completed my PhD in Machine Learning at EPFL, Switzerland. I worked [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/) (LIONS), under the supervision of Volkan Cevher. My research was focused on deep learning applied to medical imaging, mostly to problems of reconstruction and optimization of sampling trajectories for MRI. 

I am also broadly interested by generative models, inverse problems, variational inference and experiment design.
