I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at EPFL, Switzerland. I'm working at the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/) (LIONS), under the supervision of Volkan Cevher. My research is focused on deep learning applied to medical imaging, mostly to problems of reconstruction and optimization of sampling trajectories for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 

I am also broadly interested by generative models, inverse problems, variational inference and experiment design.
